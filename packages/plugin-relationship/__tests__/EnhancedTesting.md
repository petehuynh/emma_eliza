# Enhance Testing

## Objective
The primary goal of our testing enhancement initiative is to ensure comprehensive coverage of all code paths within the plugin, with special attention to:
- State transitions in the relationship management system
- Edge cases in user evaluation and response handling
- Error scenarios across all plugin functionalities

## Writing and Reviewing Tests
### Test Coverage Requirements
- Every new feature must be accompanied by corresponding test cases
- All existing code paths should have associated tests
- Each action, provider, and evaluator must have dedicated test files

### Test Types
1. **Happy Path Tests**
   - Verify expected behavior under normal conditions
   - Test successful state transitions
   - Validate correct data flow

2. **Failure Cases**
   - Test invalid inputs and error conditions
   - Verify error handling and recovery
   - Test incorrect state transitions
   - Validate boundary conditions

## Running and Fixing Tests
### Test Execution
```bash
pnpm test
```
- Run tests before committing changes
- Fix failing tests immediately to maintain code quality
- Use watch mode during development: `pnpm test --watch`

### Issue Resolution
- Address test failures as they occur
- Document any non-obvious fixes in test comments
- Update tests when requirements change

## Coverage of Edge Cases
### Critical Edge Cases
1. State Transitions
   - Transitions between all relationship states
   - Invalid state transition attempts
   - Concurrent state changes

2. User Input Handling
   - Empty or invalid inputs
   - Malformed data structures
   - Boundary values in credibility scores

3. Error Paths
   - Database connection failures
   - Invalid context data
   - Missing user information
   - Race conditions

### Testing Tools
- Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
- Implement code coverage reporting
- Use mocking utilities for external dependencies

## Integration with CI/CD
### Recommended Pipeline Integration
- Run tests automatically on pull requests
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate and track coverage reports
- Implement automated regression testing

## Best Practices
### Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Group related tests using describe blocks
- Add comments for complex test setups
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Test Independence
- Each test should be self-contained
- Clean up test data after each run
- Avoid test interdependencies
- Reset mocks between tests

### Environment Simulation
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Create test-specific configurations
- Mock external services consistently
- Provide setup scripts for test environments

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Start with unit tests for core functionality
2. Add integration tests for complex workflows
3. Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
4. Regularly review and update test coverage
5. Document testing patterns and conventions

Remember to maintain this documentation as testing practices evolve and new test cases are identified.
